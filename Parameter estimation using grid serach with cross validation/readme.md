# Parameter estimation using Grid Search with Cross Validation:

In this project you will learn about Parameter Estimation using Grid Search with Cross Validation in machine learning. 

## Dataset:

Here, we are using the digits dataset that is available in [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/datasets/plot_digits_last_image.html)

## Libraries Used:

Sklearn

## Parameter Estimation:

Parameter estimation refers to the process of using sample data (in reliability engineering, usually times-to-failure or success data) to estimate the parameters of the selected distribution.

## Grid Search:
 
A model hyperparameter is a characteristic of a model that is external to the model and whose value cannot be estimated from data. The value of the hyperparameter has to be set before the learning process begins. For example, c in Support Vector Machines, k in k-Nearest Neighbors, the number of hidden layers in Neural Networks.
 
In contrast, a parameter is an internal characteristic of the model and its value can be estimated from data. Example, beta coefficients of linear/logistic regression or support vectors in Support Vector Machines.
 
Grid search is an approach to parameter tuning that will methodically build and evaluate a model for each combination of algorithm parameters specified in a grid. 
 
## Support Vector Classifier:

The objective of a Linear SVC (Support Vector Classifier) is to fit to the data you provide, returning a "best fit" hyperplane that divides, or categorizes, your data. From there, after getting the hyperplane, you can then feed some features to your classifier to see what the "predicted" class is.

## Cross Validation:

Cross-validation is a resampling procedure used to evaluate machine learning models on a limited data sample.
