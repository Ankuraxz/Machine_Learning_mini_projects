    "## What is Stemming?\n",
    "\n",
    "Stemming is the process of reducing a word to its word stem that affixes to suffixes and prefixes or to the roots of words known as a lemma. Stemming is important in natural language understanding (NLU) and natural language processing (NLP).\n",
    "\n",
    "Stemming is a part of linguistic studies in morphology and artificial intelligence (AI) information retrieval and extraction. Stemming and AI knowledge extract meaningful information from vast sources like big data or the Internet since additional forms of a word related to a subject may need to be searched to get the best results. Stemming is also a part of queries and Internet search engines.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recognizing, searching and retrieving more forms of words returns more results. When a form of a word is recognized it can make it possible to return search results that otherwise might have been missed. That additional information retrieved is why stemming is integral to search queries and information retrieval.\n"

    "\n",
    "The process of lemmatization in natural language processing involves working with words according to their root lexical components. It is used in natural language processing and natural language understanding in computer programming and artificial intelligence.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lemmatization is a bit more complex in that the computer can group together words that do not have the same stem, but still have the same inflected meaning. Grouping the word “good” with words like “better” and “best” is an example of lemmatization. Lemmatization is also a harbinger of increased artificial intelligence sophistication – as natural language processing advances in accommodating lemmatization, it is more able to parse inputs and provide intelligent outputs. This will be an important aspect of NLP as technology gets closer to passing the Turing test with computers that hear, understand, think and speak like humans."
