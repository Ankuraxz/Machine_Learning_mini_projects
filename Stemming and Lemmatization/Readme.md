# Problem Statement:-

In this project we will be discussing about how we can perform stemming and lemmatization in python.

## Stemming:-

Stemming is the process of reducing a word to its word stem that affixes to suffixes and prefixes or to the roots of words known as a lemma. Stemming is important in natural language understanding (NLU) and natural language processing (NLP).

Recognizing, searching and retrieving more forms of words returns more results. When a form of a word is recognized it can make it possible to return search results that otherwise might have been missed. That additional information retrieved is why stemming is integral to search queries and information retrieval.

## Lemmatization:-

Lemmatization is the algorithmic process of finding the lemma of a word depending on their meaning. Lemmatization usually refers to the morphological analysis of words, which aims to remove inflectional endings. It helps in returning the base or dictionary form of a word, which is known as the lemma. The NLTK Lemmatization method is based on WorldNet's built-in morph function. Text preprocessing includes both stemming as well as lemmatization. Many people find the two terms confusing. Some treat these as same, but there is a difference between these both. Lemmatization is preferred over the former because of the below reason.

## Difference in stemming and lemmatization:-

Stemming algorithm works by cutting the suffix from the word. In a broader sense cuts either the beginning or end of the word.

On the contrary, Lemmatization is a more powerful operation, and it takes into consideration morphological analysis of the words. It returns the lemma which is the base form of all its inflectional forms. In-depth linguistic knowledge is required to create dictionaries and look for the proper form of the word. Stemming is a general operation while lemmatization is an intelligent operation where the proper form will be looked in the dictionary. Hence, lemmatization helps in forming better machine learning features.
